# Python Movie Trailer Website



This is a program utilizing python and html/css to create a static movie trailer website.

  

# Goal

  The goal is to write server-side code to store a list of my favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. The code is then used to generate a static web page allowing visitors to browse their movies and watch the trailers.

# How to use
Fork and clone the repo. CD into root directory of project. Run the entertainment_center.py file in the command line. This will bring up the webpage in your default browser.

```$ cd "root_directory"```

```$ python entertainment_center.py```



You can also:
  - Edit the placeholder movies in entertainment_center.py file with your own movie choices
  - There are a total of five options for each movie: Title, Runtime, Storyline, Poster art, and Trailer URL
  - After that run the file as outlined above
